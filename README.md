THIS MOD IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT! THERE ARE BOUND TO BE SOME THINGS THAT ARE BROKEN, MISSING, AND MORE! PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK AND ISSUES ON THE [GITHUB](https://github.com/GamingEinstein/BlockChainCurrency)!

## About
BlockChain Currency is a brand new, highly advanced, well-developed (all lies... probably) currency system designed for economy-based servers! Using the latest and greatest Block3 technologies, we hope to help alleviate the headache of deciding on what whether your SMP wants to use Diamonds or Sticks as a trading medium. Introducing BITS, the latest and greatest in coinage! The value is determined by what the server wants, so if you want it to be worthless or a commodity, you can! Surely your Bits will go to the End, right?

As always, installing [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) or equivalents will be the best way to view the items and recipes this mod offers

**A little notice:** This is my first official mod, so there will probably be some things that I can't fix by myself as I lack a lot of modding knowledge. Feel free to leave suggestions and bug reports on the [GitHub](https://github.com/GamingEinstein/BlockChainCurrency/issues), though!

## FAQ

A: Because I want feedback and testing from other people. That, and... because I felt like it

Q: cAn YoU aDd SuPpOrT fOr VeRsIoN (insert version here)
A: Currently, there are no plans to downgrade to any lower versions, nor is there plans to update to later versions (at least until NeoForge is more feature ready)

Q: WhAt AbOuT fAbRiC/qUiLt???
A: That would require me to learn another mod loader, which isn't feasible right now. That doesn't mean there aren't plans in the future, though...

Q: Why is this a question?
A: Because I want it here
