## About

BlockChain Currency is a brand new, highly advanced, well-developed (all lies... probably) currency system designed for economy-based servers! Using the latest and greatest Block3 technologies, we hope to help alleviate the headache of deciding on what whether your SMP wants to use Diamonds or Sticks as a trading medium. Introducing BITS, the latest and greatest in coinage! The value is determined by what the server wants, so if you want it to be worthless or a commodity, you can! Surely your Bits will go to the End, right?

As always, installing [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) or equivalents will be the best way to view the items and recipes this mod offers

**A little notice:** This is my first official mod, so there will probably be some things that I can't fix by myself as I lack a lot of modding knowledge. Feel free to leave suggestions and bug reports on the [GitHub](https://github.com/GamingEinstein/BlockChainCurrency/issues), though!
